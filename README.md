# J's Personal MacPorts #

Just some MacPorts I've had kicking around. Do with them as you will.

See the `LICENSE` file for details.

Any original ports that I've written are licensed under an MIT license.
Any ports that are forks or otherwise based on upstream ports are based
on whatever the license is that MacPorts uses, which as of this writing
is a 3-clause BSD license.
